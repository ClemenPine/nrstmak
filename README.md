## Background
For the past few years I've used the ![Colemak](https://colemak.com/) layout. It's a great layout, and [I've built up a decent speed on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rECAwQ8GrgM), but there are a few issues with it that I've noticed:

#### The Right Index
Colemak puts a lot of strain on the right index by placing H, L, M, and N on the index column. Not only are these letters very common (making up nearly 20% of all letters typed in English), but they also appear frequently together in close proximity. For example, NK and KN, which are found in common words such as `know` and `think`, would be typed with the same finger on colemak. These sequences are known as SFBs, or "same-finger bigrams", and are generally detrimental to speed and comfort.

Additionally, placing H on the outer index results in a lot of LSBs, or "lateral stretch bigrams". HE is a very common LSB on Colemak and is generally uncomfortable because it requires your fingers to splay.

#### The Left Pinky
On Colemak, A is placed on the left hand with the consonants, most likely to maintain similarity with Qwerty. However, this placement results in a lot of pinky trills with words such as `separate` and `arrange`. Pinky and ring fingers are usually not as dexterous as the middle and index fingers, and so over time these trilling motions, also known as "redirects", can cause strain.

#### The Letter Y
The placement of the letter Y on Colemak is often a source of discomfort. For example, `you`, despite being a fairly common word, is also a fairly uncomfortable redirect on Colemak.
